# Right Peg Match - Netlify Build Fix

This package contains a straightforward fix for your Netlify deployment issue.

## The Problem

Your Netlify build is failing because the edit-profile-page.tsx file is importing from a path that doesn't exist in the Netlify build environment:

```typescript
import { ExperienceLevel } from "../../../shared/schema";
```

## The Solution

1. Replace the original `edit-profile-page.tsx` file with the modified version provided
2. The only change is that the `ExperienceLevel` enum is now defined directly in the file rather than imported

## How to Apply This Fix

1. Make a backup of your current `client/src/pages/edit-profile-page.tsx` file
2. Copy the provided `edit-profile-page.tsx` file to `client/src/pages/edit-profile-page.tsx`
3. Deploy to Netlify again

## Why This Works

Instead of complex path mappings or build configurations, this solution directly addresses the issue by eliminating the problematic import. The `ExperienceLevel` enum is now defined inline in the file, which means it's no longer dependent on the external schema file.

## Email Notifications

Your email notification system is already implemented and working correctly with SendGrid. The backend is properly configured to send:
- Password reset emails
- New message notifications
- Weekly job match alerts

No changes are needed to the email functionality as it's handled by your backend on Replit.

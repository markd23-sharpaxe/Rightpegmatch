# Right Peg Match - Fixed Schema for Netlify Deployment

This package contains a solution for the schema import issue that's preventing your Netlify deployment from building successfully.

## The Problem

Netlify is reporting this error during build:
```
Could not resolve "../../../shared/schema" from "src/pages/edit-profile-page.tsx"
```

This happens because the build process can't find the schema file that's located outside the client directory.

## The Solution

This package includes:

1. **Modified Vite Configuration** - Updates path aliases to resolve imports correctly
2. **Local Schema Copy** - Places a compatible version of the schema in the client directory
3. **Proper Netlify Configuration** - Ensures the build process works correctly

## How to Deploy

1. Copy these files into your project:
   - `client/src/shared/schema.ts` - The local schema copy
   - `client/vite.config.ts` - The updated Vite configuration
   - `netlify.toml` - The correct Netlify settings

2. Deploy to Netlify using one of these methods:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Build locally with `npm run build` and upload the `dist` directory

## Why This Works

The solution works by:
1. Creating a local copy of the schema that contains all the types needed by the frontend
2. Setting up proper path aliases in Vite so imports resolve correctly
3. Configuring Netlify to use the right build settings

## Important Note

This fix maintains your exact app design and functionality while resolving the build issue. The schema file is a simplified version that contains just the types needed by the frontend.

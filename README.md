# Right Peg Match - Netlify Ready Deployment

This package contains your enhanced Right Peg Match application, ready for deployment on Netlify while maintaining its exact design and functionality.

## What's New

This package includes important enhancements to ensure reliable connectivity between your Netlify frontend and Replit backend:

1. **Enhanced API Connectivity**: Your app now uses multiple connection methods to ensure reliable communication:
   - Standard fetch requests (primary method)
   - JSONP requests (bypasses CORS restrictions)
   - Proxy-based requests (additional fallback)
   - Image-based connection checks

2. **Connection Status Monitoring**: A subtle status indicator has been added that shows connection status and automatically disappears when connected

3. **User-Friendly Notifications**: Toast notifications will inform users if connection is lost or restored

## Deployment Instructions

### GitHub Method (Recommended)

1. Upload this package to a GitHub repository
2. In Netlify, select "Import from Git" and choose your GitHub repository
3. Configure the following build settings:
   - Base directory: `client`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Add the environment variable:
   - Key: `VITE_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://7a407b74-b1a3-43f7-bf8a-d00fad3554e3-00-15b02g7uh8r3y.riker.replit.dev/api`
5. Deploy!

### Direct Upload Method

1. In the client directory, build the project:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. In Netlify, go to "Sites" and drag the `client/dist` folder directly onto the Netlify drag-and-drop area
3. After the initial deployment, go to "Site settings" â†’ "Environment variables" and add:
   - Key: `VITE_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://7a407b74-b1a3-43f7-bf8a-d00fad3554e3-00-15b02g7uh8r3y.riker.replit.dev/api`
4. Trigger a new deployment from the "Deploys" tab

## How It Works

The enhanced API connectivity layer works as follows:

1. When making API requests, it first tries the standard fetch method
2. If that fails due to CORS or other issues, it automatically tries alternative methods
3. The app continuously monitors the connection status and informs users of any issues
4. All this happens transparently while maintaining your app's exact design and functionality

## Testing

To test if the connectivity is working:

1. After deployment, visit your Netlify site
2. You should see a quick green "Connected to backend API" message that disappears after a few seconds
3. Try navigating through your app - all functionality should work as it does on Replit
4. If you temporarily stop your Replit server, you'll see a red connection warning appear
5. When you restart your Replit server, the connection will be automatically restored
